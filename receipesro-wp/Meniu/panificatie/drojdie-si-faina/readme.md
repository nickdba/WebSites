## Drojdia
Yeast loves warmth and humidity. Boil water in a pan near the dough’s resting place.
Add salt in the later stages of dough making. Yeast does not like salt.
Use filtered water. Yeast doesn’t like chlorine.
The water should not be too hot, because the yeast will die at 60 degrees celcius.
