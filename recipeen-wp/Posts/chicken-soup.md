# Chicken soup

Chicken soup - "Ciorba de pui" as romanians are calling it, is an all time favorite. 
Especially in the summer time, it is a must in romanian cuisine. 

You will get variations, in the recipe, between different romanian regions, but the bulk stays the same;  
Changes such as the addition of peppers or parsnip. 

The traditional soup uses bors instead of lemon for stronger aroma. Check out the <a href="./chicken-soup-romanian-version/">recipe here.</a>
