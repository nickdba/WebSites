This is a method on how to smoke a turkey using hot smoke.

### The Bath

Multiply the quantities below for enough water to cover the entire turkey.

Brine solution recipe:

10 l water
700 g pickling salt
200 g brown sugar
20g saltpetre (potassium nitrate)
20g sodium bicarbonate


Wash the turkey thoroughly with cold water and submerge it in the brine solution.  
Keep the turkey submerged with a heavy plate, for 3-5 days, in a cold environment.

### Preparation

Prepare the turkey for smoking by following these steps:

* prick any leftover feathers
* remove giblets
* remove the neck and wing tips
* wash the turkey thoroughly with cold water
* rub the seasoning(no salt) on the turkey
* wrap leg's ends and wings in tinfoil

### Smoking

For the hot smoking process you will need a smoker. I am using my Landmann Smokey Mountain Gas Smoker.

For wood chips and chunks, use a mild flavour as apple or cherry wood.

I prefer to smoke the turkey for about 7-8 hours at 100 degrees C. The water tray really helps balancing the temperature.

Take the bird out of the smoker, wrap it in tinfoil, and finish the cooking process in the oven. 
Set the temperature for 160 degrees C at fan setting. 
If you use a meat thermometer the internal temperature, near the bone, should be 75 degrees C.

Let the turkey rest for about 30 minutes before carving. Yum.
