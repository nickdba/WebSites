## Ingredients

* 1kg chicken breast
* 1/2 liter water
* 30g of sunflower oil
* salt
* peper
* 3 bay leaves

* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 50 ml tomato sauce
* mild chili(chili+paprika)
* zest from a medium lemon

## Cookware and appliances

* Knife and chopping board
* Medium Pot
* Blender
* Stove and oven

## Instructions

Wash and prepare the ingredients.  
Cut the breast into strips and put them in a medium pot, together with the water, oil, salt and peper.  
After bringing the pot to a boil, reduce heat to the lowest setting and cover with a lid.  
Simmer for roughly 15 min.

In meantime transform the rest of ingredients into a paste using a blender.  
Add the paste to the pot and allow for further 10 min of simmering, stirring occasionally.  

Heat the oven at 200 degrees celsius at fan setting.   Take the chicken strips out from the pot, onto a baking rack.
Continue to reduce the sauce left in the pot, until it thickens a bit.  

Bake the strips for 10 minutes, smear them with the sauce and continue baking for another 10 minutes.  

Let them cool down on the rack for at leat 5 minutes before serving.

## Notes

If you can substitute the oven for a covered charcoal grill, the flavour will be even more intense.
